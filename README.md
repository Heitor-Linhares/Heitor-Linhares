# 👋 Hey, I'm Heitor Rodrigues Linhares

I'm a 16-year-old **programming student** based in **Sumaré - SP, Brazil**.  
I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building useful (and sometimes just fun) stuff.

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning
- **JavaScript** and **Python**
- **Website** and **Desktop App** development
- And for extra challenge: **German** 🇩🇪

## 🖥️ My Current Setup
- 🐧 **Arch Linux** (yes, I use Arch BTW) with **GNOME**
- 🪟 Also dual-booting with **Windows 11** for when games demand it
- 🛸 **LunarVim** is my editor of choice — because regular Vim just wasn’t enough pain

## 🐧 Linux Lover
I enjoy customizing my Linux system until it feels like home — or until I break something and learn the hard way.  
Tinkering with configs is basically my weekend hobby.

## 🎮 Outside the Code
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
- Playing games
- Exploring new tools
- Debugging by yelling at the screen (it's a proven method, trust me)

## 📈 Why I'm Here
I'm using GitHub to:
- Practice and learn
- Save all my projects
- Get ready for future dev opportunities
