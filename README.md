#  Hey, I'm Heitor Rodrigues Linhares

I'm a 16-year-old **programming student** based in **Sumaré - SP, Brazil**.  
I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building useful (and sometimes just fun) stuff.

##  What I'm Learning
- **C#** and **Python**
- **Website** and **Desktop App** development
- And for extra challenge: **German** 

##  My Current Setup
-  **Endeavour OS** with **GNOME**
-  Also dual-booting with **Windows 11** for when games demand it
-  **LunarVim** is my editor of choice — because regular Vim just wasn’t enough pain

##  Linux Lover
I enjoy customizing my Linux system until it feels like home — or until I break something and learn the hard way.  
Tinkering with configs is basically my weekend hobby.

##  Outside the Code
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
- Playing games
- Exploring new tools
- Debugging by yelling at the screen (it's a proven method, trust me)

##  Why I'm Here
I'm using GitHub to:
- Practice and learn
- Save all my projects
- Get ready for future dev opportunities
